# Builder Design Pattern in C#

This repository is dedicated to demonstrating an implementation of the Builder design pattern in C#.

## About the Builder Pattern

The Builder pattern is a design pattern designed to provide a flexible solution to various object creation problems in object-oriented programming. The intent of the Builder design pattern is to separate the construction of a complex object from its representation.

## Implementation

The implementation of the Builder pattern can be found in the `BuilderPattern` directory. The directory contains the following files:

- `Builder.cs`: This file contains the abstract Builder class that defines the steps to create a complex object.
- `ConcreteBuilder.cs`: This file contains a concrete implementation of the Builder class.
- `Director.cs`: This file uses the Builder interface to construct a complex object.
- `Product.cs`: This file defines the complex object that is being built.

## Running the Code

To run the code, navigate to the `BuilderPattern` directory and use the `dotnet run` command.
