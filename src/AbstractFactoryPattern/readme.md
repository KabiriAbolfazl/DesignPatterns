# Abstract Factory Pattern

This is an implementation of the Abstract Factory design pattern in Java.

## Overview

The Abstract Factory design pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. This pattern is useful when there are multiple families of products or when the client should be insulated from the details of the object creation process.

## Structure

The implementation consists of the following components:
- `AbstractFactory`: Declares an interface for creating abstract product objects.
- `ConcreteFactory`: Implements the `AbstractFactory` interface to create concrete product objects.
- `AbstractProduct`: Declares an interface for a type of product object.
- `ConcreteProduct`: Implements the `AbstractProduct` interface to define a specific type of product object.
- `Client`: Uses the `AbstractFactory` and `AbstractProduct` interfaces to interact with products created by the factory.

## Usage

To use the Abstract Factory pattern:
1. Create new concrete factory classes that implement the `AbstractFactory` interface.
2. Create new concrete product classes that implement the `AbstractProduct` interface.
3. Use the concrete factory classes to create families of related product objects.
4. Use the client to interact with the products without knowing their concrete classes.

## Example

An example implementation of the Abstract Factory pattern can be found in the source code in this repository.
