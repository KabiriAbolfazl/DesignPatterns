# Design Patterns - Singleton Pattern

This repository contains the implementation of the Singleton Pattern in C#.

## Introduction

The Singleton Pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

## Implementation

The Singleton Pattern is implemented in the following classes:
- `SingletonPattern.java`: Contains the main Singleton class.
- `Main.java`: Contains an example of how to use the Singleton Pattern.

## Usage

To use the Singleton Pattern, follow these steps:
1. Create an instance of the Singleton class using the static `Instance` property.
2. Use the instance to access the functionalities provided by the Singleton class.
