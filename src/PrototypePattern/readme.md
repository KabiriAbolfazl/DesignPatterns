# Prototype Design Pattern

This repository contains an implementation of the Prototype design pattern in C#.

## Overview

The Prototype pattern is a creational design pattern that allows for the creation of copies of objects without the need to instantiate them from scratch. It defines a prototype interface that all classes implementing prototypes must adhere to.

## Structure

- **PrototypeInterface**: Defines the Clone method that all prototype classes must implement.
- **ConcretePrototype**: Classes that implement the prototype interface and define the specifics and behaviors of the object.
- **Client**: Responsible for using prototypes to create new copies.

## Usage

To use the Prototype pattern:
1. Implement the PrototypeInterface in your classes.
2. Create concrete classes that implement the PrototypeInterface.
3. Use the Client class to create new copies of objects.

## Example

Check out the [source code](src/PrototypePattern) for a sample implementation of the Prototype pattern in C#.
